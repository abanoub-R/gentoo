NOTE: the configuration options for both configuration files are NOT static,
      they are subject to change over time.

NOTE: mitigations have been completely disabled in .config-stable for version
	  6.4.9. this is because of a bug with clang failing to compile the kernel
	  if they are enabled. i apologize for the inconvenience

NOTE: .config-stable is built for clang/llvm, if you want a traditional gcc/
	  bin-utils compilation, just edit the beginning of the .config. the options
	  should be self explanatory.
      
[============================================================================]

there are currently 2 kernels:
        
        .config-stable
        .config-experimental

the naming is self-explanatory; .config-stable is a config that still has
most options an end-user will ever need, but still disables unneded options
that bloat up the kernel.

.config-experimental on the other hand, while much more minimal, is a lot more
dangerous / risky, some of the options it disables are including but not limited to:

        - CONFIG_RETPOLINE
        - CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD
        
it also is still a work in progress, hence the name. as of now, it works fine
but for some games like forza horizon 4, it won't work.

this file assumes you are using an amd64 desktop, with an AMD CPU and GPU, 
a standard mouse and keyboard setup with controller support added as a module, 
and a non RAID/LVM compliant setup.

this setup also assumes that you are not using a supercomputer/server,
if you are, then these configurations aren't for you.

the below software is also disabled in this configuration

        - bluetooth support
        - wireless support
        - ipv6 support
        - intel support

i am not responsible for any damage that you may or may not cause by using these
configuration files, use at your own risk, run through the kernel
settings before compiling, thank you for using this, have a nice day.
